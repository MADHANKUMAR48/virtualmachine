Introduction to Virtual Machines

Virtual machines (VMs) are software-based emulations of physical computers, running multiple isolated operating systems on a single physical machine. They are managed by a hypervisor, enabling efficient resource allocation and isolation. VMs are widely used for server consolidation, software development, and legacy application support. They provide flexibility in deployment and scalability in cloud computing environments, optimizing hardware utilization and enhancing security through isolation.
